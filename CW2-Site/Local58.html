<!--Header 2 in the chosen class-->

<p class="Channelinfo"><!--Opens a paragraph tag in the chosen class-->Starting in 2015, Local 58 (also referred to as Local 58TV)
acts as an overarching horror series, with the content being shown through 1930s like
videos, with intentional editing to have the videos look like they're from this era.
The videos start off similarly, initially seeming innocent broadcasts but all seem
to get hijacked at some point in the video, all with a similar warning, 'Don't look at
the moon. This message is more aggressively presented as the videos progress; in the video
'Show for children', viewers see an animated skeleton with an overlooking moon. The
skeleton looks into a grave to see a realistic version of himself, the next time he sees
what appears to be some sort of alien. The last time he looks into the grave, it appears to
be an endless hole, in which he falls into. After a while of walking around underground, the
video cuts to the skeleton's rotting remains in the grave after the moon leers over to look at him.

Another instance of the threat is in 'Contingency', which plays out as a Public Service Announcement,
announcing that the USA has been 'forced to surrender'. As the message concludes, instructions play out, telling
the viewers 'Place muzzle (hole of gun) to roof of mouth', 'Law enforcement has been ordered to ensure
your compliance, it is against the law to disobey' and 'This message will repeat until there are none to read it'.
It then shows the 'Victory Position', stating to 'tend to your children before yourself'.
<br>
<!--Line break-->
Lastly for the first season, 'Weather service' shows an emergency announcement with constant conflicting messages,
changing between orders both for and against looking up. After the message 'GO OUTSIDE NOW', a distorted
visual shows someone attempting to get a message through, telling viewers to not look at the moon, and to look away
from windows, and 'its in the moonlight'. Once the alert ends, cryptic text and hand-held video of the moon itself show,
all while screaming can be heard.</p>
