<!--H2 tag in the class as a visible title-->
<p class="info"><!--Opens a paragraph in the chosen class-->This video was possibly based more on the classic found footage
films, such as Blair Witch, with the message at the start about the live footage.
<br><br>
<!--Line breaks-->
The text also states the message was around 25 minutes before 'first attack', followed by
a radio station playing as the image zooms into a part of the background; this image turns to
footage of a hiker travelling through the mountain. The video cuts to an old letter, as classical music
plays and the contents of the letter is displayed through subtitles. The message involves a plan to deal
with 'beings' without giving in to them, planning to offer a bear to 'The Statue'; the closing message to someone called
Curtis hints towards a deal made with the beings. Another letter is shown, appearing to be as someone is being stalked by
something. Imagery of a wooded area is shown, with body parts and peoples names being listed and outlines fading in over the areas.
A final message states that an organism is mutating, originally a bear but it has now become unrecognisable, now resembling
a tree-like shape of flesh.
<br><br>
<!--Line breaks-->
Using aspects of body horror, especially towards the end, and being fully self-contained but with possibilites to
expand on the story, this video is a great example is someone wants to get into the genre.
