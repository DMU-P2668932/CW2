<h2 class="Channeltitle">Number 2: Facial Recognition Testing</h2>

<p class="info"> Being one of the several videos based on Five Nights at Freddys,
this video takes perspective of a hidden camera during a robot testing, maybe to
be used for employee training.
<br><br>
The video is the person offscreen testing the facial recognition on the robot,
with images of innocent people and criminals, with the robot beeping when a convict
is spotted. This process repeats until the person spots an abnormal photo and then the robot reacts,
lunging towards him as its eyes light up, before being tased by the worker. The man freaks out, mentioning
that 'we can't have that guy back here', confirming that someone snuck that photo into the pile; the worker
then quits the job. An input lost screen appears, then the message 'CRIMINAL' is heard as the photo of the man
fades in; later on the message stops as the man's face distorts, now also being purple instead of monotone.
<br><br>
Whilst people who don't know the series may be confused by certain points, the effort made by the creator for
the video shows, as the animation for the robot attacking and the photo at the end are still well made and
unsettling.
