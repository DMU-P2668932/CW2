<h2 class="Channeltitle">Number 5: The Pool Rooms</h2>

<p class="info">Being based on the idea of the Backrooms, where you can phase out of our reality
into a more dangerous one with seemingly infinite rooms and floors, this video is a slight twist on that,
but with the location looking like an abandoned water park.
<br><br>
The video uses a VHS style filter to increase the immersion and feel that the video has been found and
uploaded. It shows several scenes of the camera holder slowly walking around the rooms, trying to
document the area, as the ambience of the floor is only disturbed by wading through the pool. There
are several more of these types of shots as the person tries to navigate through the rooms, with the
ambience getting louder as the video continues. The video cuts to the person running through one of the
earlier floors, away from someone or something that was in the floor earlier. The persons breathing and
footsteps from behind get louder and quicker, as the background noise starts to 'pop', possibly causing
an effect on the camera. The pitch of the ambience then increases before the footage fades to black.
<br><br>
Whilst still having horror elements, and possibly being an introduction to the series, the video is last
on the list due to the overall repeition for the main part, with horror being too sudden at the end.
