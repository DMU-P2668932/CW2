<h2 class="Channeltitle">Number 3: CORNERGIRL</h2>

<p class="info">Whilst the audio from this appears to be taken from a children's
tutorial on shapes, the subtitles show different messages from someone claiming
not to be the video's creator (Alex Kansas), with the being controlling the text
saying that Alex based one of his other characters on them, as the lifeless body
of a girl can also be seen. The text then states 'You are luggage too', as the cameraman
moves the body. The video ends with the corner of a room as the text can faintly be read,
'Sincerely, Alex's Inspiration'.
<br><br>
Whilst being a simpler video, the unmatched audio with the text, as well as the lifeless body
still portray an unsettling image, and questions regarding why the cameraman would be filming this.
Unfortunately some parts of the video, such as the person that the text was based on, wouldn't make
sense to people who haven't watched the channel's other videos.
