<p class="Channelinfo"><!--Opens a paragraph in the chosen class-->Like some other creators of analogue horror videos, Memebear used
the Five Nights at Freddy's series of horror games for the basis of the series. Possibly
based upon the series' unintended attraction to younger people, Memebear's videos take on an
increased horror level, using elements of body horror and exploiting phobias for some of the imagery,
such as scopophobia (the fear of being stared at). Memebear also chose to stick with the jumpscare style
of horror also, and chose to not have massive elements of story to the videos, so that they could be percieved
as being a part of the Five Nights at Freddy's story.
<br>
<!--Line break-->
Many of the videos on Memebear's channel use .mp4 as a suffix to the title, further referencing to the analogue genre
and increasing the believability to the video. One of the videos, Office_Footage.mp4, shows a dark, open office with a
large hallway in the centre, with a static filter on the video. After the camera pans to the sides, a bright figure appears
off into the distance of the hallway, looking like a distorted image of a child's face. Using this to entice viewers to look
closer, some sort of singing or lullaby can be heard as the image clears up slightly. The words 'I'm coming for you' are suddenly
spoken, before the face disappears and the music is replaced with heavy footsteps, and an animatronic bear sprints towards the camera.

Another one of the videos, nightmare.mp4, which is labelled as non-canon to Memebear's view of the story. This video instead takes
perspective in a bedroom, with the perspective likely being that of a small child. The child looks around the room a few times, until
the perspective turns around to the bed, with a distorted bear plush sitting infront of the camera. The camera quickly pans to check the room
again, before breathing is heard, and the plush transforms into a yellow bear head. The torch light dies out, as the child breathes rapidly
and proceeds to be attacked by the bear. The screen pauses before cutting to an 80's era recording of the fixed bear at a presentation,
before its view meets the camera and the screen cuts to later, where an accident has occured. Police sirens are heard as the bear stays
motionless, with a bloodied lower jaw and something in its mouth.</p>
