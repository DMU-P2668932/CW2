<p class="info"><!--Opens a paragraph in the chosen class-->The found footage subgenre of horror is mostly known to have been started
with The Blair Witch Project, released in 1999. The film was set as a pioneer for the horror
genre, with the film being set as camera footage, showing a group of people going to a wooded area,
searching for the acclaimed 'Blair Witch'.That night, the activity of the witch seems to begin, possibly as a result of disturbing the
cemetery. Finding that there's now a new cairn for each of the members, also finding symbols made of twigs as
they travel south. One of the members disappears, with his screams being heard in the night, with parts of his shirt
and parts of his finger and tongue being with another of the stick figures. Following more of his screams, the group find
a building with symbols and bloodied hand prints decorating it, and enter the basement. Both of the remaining members are
then attacked by something offscreen, before the video cuts.

Another film, while technically not 100% being in the genre but has aspects, is the 2000 japanese film Ringu. In the fiim,
there's a possessed VHS tape, being haunted by the spirit of a psychic called Sadako, who was trapped in a well and died there. If a character
watches the tape, they have 7 days to pass it on, or else the spirit crawls out of the person's TV and kills them.

Being more like Blair Witch, REC is another horror film that uses camera footage for the main perspective. This film is instead located in a
Spanish hotel, where a film crew and the occupants are quarantined after a virus outbreak. As the cast slowly get killed off or turned,
the main cast enter the attic to discover demonic symbols and text, before a larger demonic infected kills the main cameraman. The
presenter grabs the camera before hiding, but she get dragged into the darkness as the film ends.

There are many other found-footage horror films, such as Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield, which ended up stagnating the genre with
similar themes. This could have been where the analogue perspective came in.
