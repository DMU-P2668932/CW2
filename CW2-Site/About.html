<p class="About"><!--Opens a paragraph tag in the chosen class-->Analogue horror is overall quite similar to found footage, but
instead usually has the viewer as the main character. The formats of the videos
commonly take on that of messages or files, such as EAS alerts or .mp4 files; the
videos overall follow a theme of starting seemingly innocent or boring, and drip-feeding the horror elements
until a climax at the end of the video.
The genre possibly started with the EAS videos that many made on YouTube, using audio moreso
than visuals to portray the horror elements. These videos then expanded into other styles
of videos, such as news or TV broadcasts, or security footage; this also sometimes extends
to the channel, as some that present the videos as news broadcasts present the channel as
a news channel. Local58 was the first channel to implement these elements, causing several
imitations after the first video was uploaded. As the genre began to grow, users started to bring
other themes into their videos, such as many using the Five Nights at Freddy's lore, and expanding on it
or adapting themes of the series into the videos. Another example of this is the idea of 'The Backrooms',
where someone can phase out of our reality and into another, much more dangerous one.

Whilst the genre definitely existed before, popularity and content were viewed by many during the recent
character in the majority of these videos, similar to ARGs (alternate reality games), so the
mundaneness of being stuck at home would be broken up with the surreal and paranormal nature of
analogue horror.</p>
