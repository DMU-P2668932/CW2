<p class="Channelinfo"><!--Opens a paragraph in the chosen class-->Being one of the most popular analogue horror series, the Mandela
Catalogue was likely many viewer's introduction to the genre. The series takes Place
in the recent USA, where beings known as 'Alternates' have attacked, with the government
and Mandela County attempting to stop them. The viewer is dragged in through the PSAs released
by the government, showing the dangers of the 'alternates' and how to stay safe. Occasionally, the
alternates seem to hack into the video and display their own messages.
<br>
<!--Line break-->
The name for the series and town wheere it's set is based on the 'Mandela Effect', where someone's memories
that they're certain are true, are actually false or inaccurate. Some popular examples include Rich Uncle Pennybags
(The Monopoly Man) never having a monocle, when many people remember him wearing one; another is that in Star Wars
episode 5: The Empire Strikes back, Darth Vader actually said 'No, I am your father', but people thought he said
'Luke, I am your father'. Whilst these phenomena are most likely just a large-scale case of false memories, some
think this could be evidence of alternate realities, and those who remember it differently were transported here from
another reality.
<br>
<!--Line break-->
This phenomena then links to the series with the alternates being from the theorized alternate reality, but instead of the
memories being different, the people are. The United States Department of Temporal Phenomena report that there's been an invasion of
the entire USA, if not global. The video titled 'The THINK Principle' displays one of the PSAs released, announcing the alternate's
arrival and how to stay safe from them. Whist some of the alternates are described as being identical, some are stated as having
'biologically impossible characteristics', with the instructions for both being to run and hide. After explaining what to do incase
of an encounter, the video temporarily glitches before starting to explain the THINK principle, which is what people should do if
they encounter an alternate.
Tell the authorities about the encounter.
Hinder the alternate's movement.
Identify the class type.
Neutralise the alternate, if safe.
Kill Yourself, there's not enough room for the two of us.
The last part is likely the result of an alternate accessing the footage, proving their hostile nature. Afterwards, the audio reverses
to instead say Know your place in reality, the actual last part of the instructions.
<br>
<!--Line break-->
The video then explains the 'classes' of alternates;
The dopplegangers, which are almost one-to-one with the original person.
The 'Detectable', that start to have abnormalities to them. The video showing this feature also gets distorted and the audio more harsh.
The third type, which is untitled, seem to be complete horrors in comparison to the regular person, with only static being in the background.
