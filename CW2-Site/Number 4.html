<h2 class="Channeltitle">Number 4: Kid Safety Tips</h2>

<p class="info">The video appears to be some sort of dystopian-era government announcement,
'The Church of the Future Light', with the video bein a part of the 'Archive of Obsolete Media'
<br><br>
This video portrays a psa style film directed to children, using a robotic voice as the narrator.
The film acts as safety instructions, telling children what to do if a stranger approaches them,
using genuine tips about if a stranger approaches, before it abruptly cuts with a static noise to
camera footage dated in 1989, showing a snowy park from through a window. The video cuts back to the
tips, with the parents now approaching the children, but the video questions this, saying to look for
the glow in their eyes and scratches in their voices, then saying they'll 'take you to somewhere fun'.
<br><br>
'Playtime Safety' now tells the children about staying safe around playground equipment, such as
not going to old refrigerators (further hinting to the dystopian era), and 'the doorway', saying it will
be fun and not to close your eyes. The 1989 footage then returns again quicky and back to the psa, instructing
children to open their windows at night so the voices can take you to the doorway. The video goes to the camera
footage for one more time, as a sort of black sludge splatters on the window in an attempt to attack the cameraperson.
<br><br>
The switching perspectives acts as a positive for the video, as well as the prison-style nature of the video being
archived, but the text-to-speech voice acts as a negative for it, as it draws out the immersion for it.
